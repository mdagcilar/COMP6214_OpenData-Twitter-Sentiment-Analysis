In order to set up:

1) Copy contents of ./odi to web server, using ./odi/public as public_html folder.
2) .env is set up for environment we used, can be adjusted for custom AWS RDS servers and Twitter API keys
3) Set up local MySQL database called "cache" with following structure to be used for caching (migrations do not work due to multiple database servers)
    -id <bigint>
    -response <text>
    -created_at <datetime>
    -updated_at <datetime>

4) In terminal, run `npm install` to install dependencies. 
5) For any issues, consult Laravel Setup Documentation (https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/installation).
